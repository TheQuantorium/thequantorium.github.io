{"state":{"html_intro":"<p>The fundamental human attribute is trust. It is what has made our\ncivilisation dominate the planet: our inherent ability to trust others\nand to deliver for those who trust us. That attribute has allowed\nrelationships to be forged between tribes, between empires, between\ncivilisations. But, since the mid-1800s, humanity has faced an\nexistential crisis of trust.</p>\n<p>One of the fundamental properties of trust is that it takes time to\nforge. If we trusted everyone immediately, our species would have been\neradicated very quickly indeed. But, with globalisation, with people\ntraversing the globe at an ever-increasing rate, and now with\ncommunications occurring almost instantaneously between people who have\nnever met, things have changed. It is said that only 7% of human\ncommunication is made up of words, the rest is body language,\npositioning, intonation, facial expressions. Yet not one of these can be\nconveyed through the media we have in this internet age. How many times\nhas a text been misinterpreted, a video call frozen, or a phone call cut\nout?</p>\n<p>If trust is the fundamental quality of humanity as a social species,\nthen we have interrupted it. We have given rise to mass interactions\nover the internet where trust cannot be formed. Online games spend\nthousands on anti-hacking software, banks spend millions on server\nsecurity, and companies the world over engage dubious firms that claim\nto provide anti-ransomware systems, all to try to mitigate the\nphenomenon that trust has been lost.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that modernity has brought things that would once have\nbeen considered miracles: penicillin has cured countless diseases,\nvaccination has wiped smallpox from the face of the Earth, and the\ninternet has brought access to knowledge and information to billions.\nBut it has also created this problem of trust. As with any problem\nbrought about by the trajectory of modernity, there are two solutions:\ngo forward, or go back. To go back is to give up the internet, to give up\nglobalisation, to give up the means for protesters to organise across\nthe globe in defiance of brutal authoritarian regimes. To go back is to\ndestroy society as we know it.</p>\n<p>To go forward is to brave the unknown. To dive into the depths of the\nfuture and say &quot;we will make it&quot;. To have confidence, trust, in not\none, but a billion. To trust the very human race itself, because, if\nthere is one thing that we have always proven, time and time again, it\nis that human innovation is unstoppable. No problem is so\ninsurmountable, so complex, or so nuanced that the human race, given\ntime, cannot solve it.</p>\n<p>So let us solve the problem of trust, together.</p>\n<p>In 2009, when the Bitcoin paper was published, the human race was set on\na course that very few could have predicted: one in which the internet\nwould begin to solve the problem of trust with mathematics and cryptography. One in which\nthat which had been removed from human interaction over networks could\nbe brought back through code. It was called <em>blockchain</em>, and it has\nbegun, slowly, to change the world.</p>\n<p>Today, blockchain has become the subject of an unfortunate hype, with\ndevelopers focused solely on building applications to take advantage of\nthis technology, and consumers caught in the middle between thousands of\nso-called <em>cryptocurrencies</em>, very few of which seem to offer anything\nmore than a quick buck, if that. Almost no-one has stopped to wonder: is this the\nbest way to decentralise our society?</p>\n<p>To understand this, we must return to the fundamental nature of\ndecentralisation itself. To decentralise is to remove power from some\ncentral authority, and grant it entirely to the people. Democracy is not\ndecentralisation, not in most countries, because the right to vote is controlled by\ncentral authorities. Because the courts can strike down the popular will\nat their discretion. Because a central government comprised principally\nof money-sucking, unelected bureaucrats has overtaken the principle of government\nfor the people, and by the people. The very notion of 'state secrets'\ncannot exemplify this more: a government 'by the people' keeping\nsecrets from the people. To have trust in decentralised systems is to\nsomehow ensure that the participants in the system cannot thwart the\nsystem itself, to such an extent that anyone in the system can do\nbusiness with any other, without knowing them in person at all. Perhaps\nthis removes humanity from interactions, but trust takes time:\ncryptography does not. If we can provide trust at a mathematical level,\nshould this not become the default in our globalised world? Already, the\naverage person has more 'friends' on social media than they have in\nreal life. In some ways, is this not already the default?</p>\n<p>Blockchain provides cryptographic solutions to the problems of trust by\nhaving the subject of trust, a ledger, be stored by everyone, and this\nis its first problem: nothing of consequence can be stored on the\nledger. Try to submit a photo archive to a blockchain, and you'd be\nbankrupted by the transaction fees. Everyone in the system would have to\nstore your photos, whether they want to or not. A rather paradoxical\ndefinition of <em>trust</em>, don't you think? Further, a blockchain must\nhave a proof mechanism behind it, by which trust is verified\nover time. In Bitcoin, this is called <em>proof of work</em>, an algorithm so\nenergy-intensive that Bitcoin mining in 2019 used as much energy per\nannum as the entirety of Spain. In a world wracked by a rapidly\nwarming climate, this version of trust is a highly short-term one ---\nalthough it may well become the only definition if we all end\nup in bunkers, sheltering from volcanic ash and rising seas. While other\nproof mechanisms have been proposed, such as <em>proof of stake</em>,\n<a class=\"text-emerald-500 underline\" href=\"https://medium.com/@BobMcElrath/whats-wrong-with-proof-of-stake-77d4f370be15\">questions have been raised</a>\nconsistently about their efficacy, and the extent to which they in fact re-centralise the systems they aim to\ndecentralise.</p>\n<p>Again, not once has anyone considered the logic of disruption, somewhat\nstartlingly for a group of people so intent on changing the world: the\nultimate form of disruption is to overturn and improve the most basic\nfundamental of the system you're looking at.\n<strong>Blockchain is broken, and it always will be.</strong> The fundamental\ncompromises of the system render it infeasible to use it for meaningful\ndecentralisation: look to the 'smart contracts' of Ethereum, and\nnotice how their logic must be executed by every single participant in\nthe network --- complex logic is impossible.</p>\n<p>Blockchain's time is up, because a solution to its problems exists.\nWe have called it <em>The Quantorium</em>. This is a network comprised of three pieces: <em>Lykros</em>, a system that\nensures the security of data mathematically, such that no-one can change\ncontent without permission, while allowing meaningful collaboration at\nthe cryptographic level. Lykros is the first system in the world to\nprovide cryptographic protection for a comprehensive suite of\noperations, including, as a world-first: sharing other permissions. The\nsecond piece is <em>Kolaris</em>, a decentralised network of nodes that can be\nadded to or subtracted from automatically, that spans the entire planet.\nAnyone can run a node, and anyone can submit data to nodes, without\nneeding to be part of the network themselves. These nodes store data,\nencrypted and controlled with Lykros, and replicate it among themselves\nto prevent both faults and lies --- combining the two pieces provides a\nsystem that can be <em>trusted</em>. Beyond storage, Kolaris also facilitates\ndecentralised computation, allowing anyone to tap into the spare\ncomputing resources of the entire planet and compute what they wish,\nwithout needing to control expensive infrastructure themselves. These\nfeatures not only decentralise power from existing companies that have\nruled this space for decades, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft,\nthey empower individuals to earn money from these systems through a\nprice mechanism that ensures both the stability and continuity of the\nnetwork. Kolaris is most similar to the <em>distributed hash tables</em> of\ntoday, but it is designed from the ground up with dozens of innovative\nsecurity mechanisms to protect both the security and integrity of data,\nand to allow entirely untrusted nodes to join the network in droves,\nwithout fear of attack.</p>\n<p>Further, Kolaris enables <em>verifiable computation</em>, whereby an individual\ncan submit a computation and prove its result to others, through\nreplication, economic incentives, and cryptography. This, when combined\nwith the correct system-specific incentives, can facilitate the development of\n<em>decentralised oracles</em>, a hypothetical 'holy grail' technology that\nwould allow a decentralised system to glean information from entirely different\nsystems, without any trusted intermediary.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is <em>Miriar</em>, a true replacement to blockchain that provides a\ndecentralised ledger replicated across all nodes, for certain tasks that\nKolaris itself cannot perform on its own (such as single-hop, cryptographically\nverifiable, infallible routing), without needing any expensive proof\nmechanism. Through the ways Kolaris registers nodes in its own system,\ninformation can be propagated to update this ledger using Lykros'\nrevolutionary <em>patch-based versioning</em> algorithm, which allows\ncryptographically verifiable additions to data at rates of thousands\nper minute, without sacrificing security. Put simply, the proof\nmechanisms of blockchains are rendered totally obsolete, while retaining\nthe exact same level of security, if not a substantially greater one.</p>\n<p>Together, these three systems form The Quantorium, a network of\ndecentralised nodes that will be deployed across the planet to serve the\nentire human race. Cryptocurrencies could trivially run on this system,\nbut they are an afterthought. The goal here is not to earn some\nworthless token that the founders use to get rich, the goal is the\ngenuine, and absolute improvement of the human race, forever. Through\nthis system, journalists can host materials on decentralised websites\nthat cannot be censored by authoritarian governments, anonymity can be\nensured for protesters, individuals can organise globally to form\nmovements to take down the dictatorships of yesteryear, while\ncompanies can offload their infrastructure costs and usher in a new\nmodel of payment, in which users pay for the storage and computation\nthey need, and the company bears no cost at all. This has been proposed\nbefore, but never with the decentralised technology to meaningfully back\nit in the long-term.</p>\n<p>If this works, of course, there will be thousands of systems working on\nold blockchain technology that will be likely abandoned, and many more\nthat will hopefully transition to this new network. Whether blockchain and\nthe Quantorium will work side-by-side remains to be seen. But together, the three\nprotocols that underlie the Quantorium can revolutionise human\ninteraction over networks, by facilitating the practical verification of\ntrust at all levels of engagement. A transaction can be ensured, a vote\nset in stone, a resource publicly administered.\nTransferring the revolutionary principles of <em>decentralised autonomous\norganisations</em> (DAOs) to this network provides all the benefits they did\non the Ethereum blockchain, but with access to storage and computation\nsystems that were previously unheard of.</p>\n<p>To make this happen, there are four stages: the protocols must be\nwritten, implementations of them must be built, nodes must be run, and\nawareness must be raised. The first stage has already been completed:\nand the theoretical systems of these protocols have been set down, not\nin whitepapers intended to advertise them, but in honest papers of\nconsiderable length that examine in depth every aspect of these systems,\nwith full mathematical backing. The second stage will take time, but it is\nalready underway. At present, it is likely that the greatest efficiency\nwill be achieved by a small team working on these in the open, before\nwider contribution is allowed back to the project, and that is what is\nhappening now.</p>\n<p>The final two stages are where we need your help: without you, this\nsystem cannot become a reality, because it is based on <em>nodes</em>,\ncomputers that people connect to the network to become part of it. If\nyou have a device that has an uninterrupted internet connection, and if\nyou have the internet bandwidth to have that device automatically engage\nwith clients, and the storage for it to store encrypted data, or the\ncomputation power for it to form part of the computation grid, please\nconnect it to the Quantorium. This is not a purely altruistic endeavour\neither, the Quantorium is built on an infallible payment mechanism that\nunderlies Kolaris, and you will be compensated for your efforts: not in\nsome wishy-washy new &quot;altcoin&quot;, but in Monero, an\nuntraceable cryptocurrency built on a proof of work blockchain. That\nwill allow a cryptocurrency to be built simultaneously with the rest of\nthe systems, while the final problems are ironed out there, before it\neventually launches. We also do this to make one thing clear: <strong>we are\nnot in this to get rich, we are in this to improve the world</strong>. If you\nexpect to earn millions from running a node, you will be disappointed.\nThere is no mining in this system, there is only the provision of\nstorage and computation. And, if you provide too much, if your presence\non the network becomes outsized, you will be removed from the network to\nensure its ongoing stability and success: no one actor can ever control\ntoo much of the network, no matter their resources.</p>\n<p>Finally, raising awareness. No matter how brilliant the technology, no\nsystem can ever become useful if people don't know it exists. So\nplease, share this document, and share the ideas behind it. Tweet about it,\nmessage your friends, and join our mailing list for updates about the\nsystem itself (we will never, ever send you spam, and you can opt out at\nany time).</p>\n<p>The future of trust is in going forward boldly into a brave new world,\nbut it is our duty to ensure that in that world, we build a true\ndemocracy, a true rule of the people, in which governments, companies,\nand the powerful are not technically, but <em>fundamentally</em> beholden to the\nwill of the people.</p>\n<p>So let's create the future of decentralisation, and the future of\ntrust, together. Join us.</p>\n"},"head":"<title>The Quantorium</title><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\".perseus/static/index.css\"/>"}
